## Custom CSS/JS

The theme provides two ways for custom css/js. The first way is writing your styles to `/assets/css/custom.css` and scripts to `/assets/js/custom.js`. This will merge and minify the styles/scripts with the theme specific files resulting in only one file for the whole website.

```toml
[params]
  js=["/js/test_site.js"]
  jscdn=["https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.x/dist/vue.js"]
  css=["/css/test_site.css"]
  csscdn=["https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto&display=swap"]
```

```yaml
---
js:
    - /js/test.js
jscdn:
    - https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.x/dist/vue.js
css:
    - /css/test.css
csscdn:
    - https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:100,300,400,500,700,900
---
```
